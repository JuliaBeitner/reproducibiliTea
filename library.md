Here we'll have details of the journal club join [Zotero](https://zotero.org/) library. It'll have an individual folder ('collection') for each Journal Club, with potentially sub-collections for each of the terms. 

We'll also have a collection for recommended first-term papers. 

Items can appear in multiple collections, so we should be able to reduce duplication over the whole system periodically and work out where there is/n't overlap.
