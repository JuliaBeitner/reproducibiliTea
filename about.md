ReproducibiliTea journal clubs help young researchers build a local community of ECRs interested in open and reproducible research. It can be isolating to be one of the few within a research group, or department, that are actively engaged in improving research practices. ReproducibiliTea helps researchers who want to change this. 

In the ReproducibiliTea Journal Club, papers are selected that are broadly relevant to the replication crisis and scientific improvements. They are then discussed during regular journal club meetings. The ReproducibiliTea Journal Club has proven to be a success in Oxford, where it was founded, and has received widespread international recognition. There are now more than 27 other ReproducibiliTea Journal Clubs registered to date, with more joining at an increasingly faster rate.
